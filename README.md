# The Fine Command Line

Here is the plan: A floating input shows up, you a enter a command and you're done. You can use `<Tab>` completion like the regular `cmdline`, and can also navigate the command history with `<Up>` and `<Down>` arrows. That's it.

My hope is that someone else with more knowledge sees this and inspires them to make a [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin with the same features.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Neovim v0.5.1](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.5.1) or greater.

### Dependencies

- [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim)

### Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager. For example.

With `vim-plug`

```vim
Plug 'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim'
Plug 'VonHeikemen/fine-cmdline.nvim'
```

With `packer`.

```lua
use {
  'VonHeikemen/fine-cmdline.nvim',
  requires = {
    {'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim'}
  }
}
```

## Usage

You just need to require this plugin and call `.open()`... in a keybinding.

With lua.

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
  'n',
  '<C-p>',
  ':lua require("fine-cmdline").open()<CR>',
  {noremap = true}
)
```

Or use vimscript.

```vim
nnoremap <C-p> :lua require('fine-cmdline').open()<CR>
```

### Configuration

If you want to change anything from the `ui` or add a "hook" you can use `.setup()`.

This are the defaults.

```lua
require('fine-cmdline').setup({
  popup = {
    position = {
      row = '10%',
      col = '50%',
    },
    size = {
      width = '60%',
      height = 1
    },
    border = {
      style = 'rounded',
      highlight = 'FloatBorder',
    },
    win_options = {
      winhighlight = 'Normal:Normal',
    },
  },
  hooks = {
    before_mount = function(input)
      -- code
    end,
    after_mount = function(input)
      -- code
    end,
    set_keymaps = function(imap, feedkeys)
      -- code
    end
  }
})
```

- `popup` is passed directly to `nui.popup`. You can check the valid keys in their documentation: [popup.options](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim/tree/main/lua/nui/popup#options)

- `hooks` must be functions. They will be executed during the "lifecycle" of the input.

`before_mount` and `after_mount` recieve the instance of the input, so you can do anything with it.

`set_keymaps`. Why is this even in a "hook"? Funny story, you can only map keys after the input is mounted. And there are other not so funny quirks. So I thought I could make things easier for you.

### Setting keymaps

With `set_keymaps` you get two parameters. `imap` makes non-recursive mappings in insert mode. `feedkeys` types keys for you (because of reasons).

Let's say you want to create a shortcut (`Alt + s`) for a simple search and replace.

```lua
set_keymaps = function(imap, feedkeys)
  imap('<M-s>', '%s///gc<Left><Left><Left><Left>')
end
```

If you need something more complex you can use a function.

```lua
set_keymaps = function(imap, feedkeys)
  imap('<M-s>', function()
    if vim.fn.pumvisible() == 0 then
      feedkeys('%s///gc<Left><Left><Left><Left>')
    end
  end)
end
```

There are a few utility functions you could use, they are available under `.fn`.

```lua
local fn = require('fine-cmdline').fn
```

- `fn.close`: If completion menu is visible, hide it. Else, unmounts the input.

- `fn.next_item`: Go to the next item in the completion list.

- `fn.previous_item`: Go to the previous item in the completion list.

- `fn.complete_or_next_item`: Shows the completion menu if is not visible. Else, navigates to the next item in the completion list.

- `fn.up_history`: Replaces the text in the input with the previous entry in the command history.

- `fn.down_history`: Replaces the text in the input with the next entry in the command history.

If you wanted to navigate command history with `Alt + k` and `Alt + j`.

```lua
set_keymaps = function(imap, feedkeys)
  local fn = require('fine-cmdline').fn

  imap('<M-k>', fn.up_history)
  imap('<M-j>', fn.down_history)
end
```

## Caveats

This is not a special mode. It's just a normal buffer, incremental search will not work here.

## Contributing

How nice of you. Keep in mind I want to keep this plugin small. Scope creep is the enemy. This thing already does everything I want.

Bug fixes are welcome. Suggestions to improve defaults. Maybe some tweaks to the lua public api.

If you want to improve the ui it will be better if you contribute to [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim).
